\section{Linear Equations}

  A linear equation over with unknowns is represented by $\forall \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}, b \in K,\ \ a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n = b$.
  A system of linear equations is a set of $L$'s, where $L$ is a linear equation as above.
  Linear equations form a vector space that can be scaled.
  
  Given a system of linear equations with unknowns, a solution vector $u = (a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ is something that simultaneously satisfies all of the linear equations.
  
  \subsection{Definitions}
  
    \begin{description}
      \item[Augmented Matrix]  Given a system of linear equations defined above, the augmented matrix is:\\
      $M = \left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
        a_{11} & \ldots & b_1 \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        a_{m1} & \ldots & b_m 
      \end{array}\right]$

      \item[Equivalent Systems of Linear Equations] Two system of linear equations are equivalent if they have the same system.
      More precisely, $M_1$ and $M_2$ are equivalent when the rows of one are linear combinations of the rows of the other. 
      This means that systems of linear equations are equivalen when they are row equivalent.

      \item[Elementary Row Operation (ERO)] An ERO is an operation of either interchanging two rows, replacing a row with a multiple of itself, or replacing a row with the addition of itself and another row.

      \item[Row Echelon Form] Row echelon form consists of a matrix such that each leftmost nonzero entry of a row is to the right of the leftmost nonzero entry of each proceeding row, all zero rows are at the bottom of the matrix.

      \item[Row Canonical Form (Reduced Row Echelon) (Fully Reduced)] Row canonical form or full reduced matrix form is a matrix that satisfies row echelon form where every first entry in each row is 1.

      \item[Pivot] A pivot is the first nonzero entry in a row of a matrix in row ecehlon form.

  \subsection{Theorems}
  
    \subsubsection{Solution to Linear Equation}
    
      If $u$ is the solution to a linear equation where $L_1: x_1 + x_2 = 0; L_2 = x_1 - x_2 = 3; L_1 + L_2: 2x_1 = 3$ then $x_1 = 3/2, x_2 = -3/2$ by back substitution.
      
    \subsubsection{Non-Invertible Matrix}

      A matrix is not invertible if there exists some nonzero vector such that the matrix multiplied by the vector is 0.

    \subsubsection{Every ERO has an inverse operation}
